# Live Score Predictions - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### Visual Indicators on Cards

**Green Indicator (At least one prediction hitting):**
- Green dot (pulsing)
- Green border with glow
- Prediction text in green

**Red Indicator (No predictions hitting):**
- Red dot (solid)
- Red border with subtle glow
- Prediction text in red/gray

**No Predictions:**

### On-Card Information Display

Each card now shows:

1. **Dot Indicator** (left side)
   - Green (pulsing) = at least one prediction hitting
   - Red (solid) = predictions not hitting
   - None = no predictions

2. **Team Names & Scores** (center)
   - Away Team abbreviation + score
   - Separator
   - Home Team abbreviation + score

3. **Model Predictions** (right side)
   - **Spread Pick**: Shows which team + spread
     - Example: "KC -3" or "BUF +3"
     - Green if hitting, red if not
   - **Over/Under Pick**: Shows O or U + line
     - Example: "O 52.5" or "U 45"
     - Green if hitting, red if not

### Hover for Details

Hovering over any card with predictions shows expanded view:
- Team circles with colors
- Current scores
- All three bet types (Moneyline, Spread, Over/Under)
- Checkmarks for hitting predictions
- X marks for not hitting
- Probability percentages

## How Predictions Are Calculated

### Moneyline
- **Predicted**: Team with >50% probability wins
- **Hitting**: Predicted team is currently ahead

### Spread
- **Predicted**: Team with >50% probability covers spread
- **Hitting**: Team is covering the spread based on current score
  - Calculation: (current_score_diff + spread_line)
  - If predicted Home and adjusted_diff > 0 → Hitting
  - If predicted Away and adjusted_diff < 0 → Hitting

### Over/Under
- **Predicted**: Over if probability >50%, else Under
- **Hitting**: 
  - Over: current_total > line
  - Under: current_total < line

## Team Name Matching

Handles differences between ESPN (full names) and prediction tables (city names):

**ESPN Format**: "Kansas City Chiefs", "Buffalo Bills", "Alabama Crimson Tide"
**Database Format**: "Kansas City", "Buffalo", "Alabama"

**Matching Logic**:
1. Strips mascot names (Chiefs, Bills, Tide, etc.)
2. Compares city/school names
3. Works for both NFL and CFB

## Card Layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🟢 BUF 24 - 21 KC     KC -3   ← Spread │
│                       O 52.5  ← O/U     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ↑    ↑     ↑    ↑      ↑
   Dot  Away  Score Home  Predictions
```

## Color Scheme

- **Hitting (Green)**: #BFEF77 (honeydew-500)
- **Not Hitting (Red)**: theme destructive color
- **Borders**: Same color with opacity and glow effect
