# Debug Team Matching Issue

## What I Just Added

Enhanced logging to show exactly why teams aren't matching between live scores and predictions.

## What To Do Now

1. **Refresh your browser** (hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

2. **Open the browser console** (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console tab)

3. **Look for these log messages:**

### Expected Console Output:

```
📺 Fetched X live games from ESPN
📺 Sample live game teams: { league: "NFL", home: "Kansas City Chiefs", away: "Buffalo Bills" }

📊 Fetched Y NFL predictions with lines
📊 Sample NFL prediction teams: { home: "Kansas City", away: "Buffalo" }

🔍 Trying to match NFL game: Buffalo Bills @ Kansas City Chiefs
   ❌ No match with prediction: Buffalo @ Kansas City
   ⚠️  No prediction found for NFL game: Buffalo Bills @ Kansas City Chiefs
```

## What I Need From You

**Please copy and paste the console logs showing:**

1. The "📺 Sample live game teams" line - shows ESPN data format
2. The "📊 Sample NFL prediction teams" line - shows prediction table format  
3. A few of the "🔍 Trying to match" lines - shows why they're not matching

This will tell me if the issue is:
- **Full names vs short names** (e.g., "Kansas City Chiefs" vs "Kansas City")
- **Different formatting** (e.g., "LA Rams" vs "Los Angeles Rams")
- **Missing data** (no predictions for today's games)

## Likely Issue

I suspect the prediction tables use **city names only** (e.g., "Kansas City", "Buffalo") while ESPN uses **full team names** (e.g., "Kansas City Chiefs", "Buffalo Bills").

If that's the case, the fix is simple - I just need to update the matching logic to handle this format difference.
