# Chat Session Context Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified
The mini chat bot was using a **single global session per user** across all pages, which caused:
1. When switching between NFL and College Football pages, the chat would load the old thread with outdated context
2. Page-specific game data wasn't being passed to the chat bot properly
3. Old conversations with old data persisted across page changes

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Page-Specific Session Management
**Modified Files:**
- `src/utils/chatSession.ts`
- `src/components/MiniWagerBotChat.tsx`
- `src/components/ChatKitWrapper.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `pageId` field to `ChatSession` interface to identify which page the session belongs to
- Updated `getCurrentSession()` to accept optional `pageId` parameter for page-specific lookups
- Updated `createNewSession()` to accept optional `pageId` and store it with the session
- Updated `setCurrentSession()` to store page-specific sessions in localStorage with keys like `wagerbot_current_session_nfl` and `wagerbot_current_session_college-football`
- Added `clearPageSession()` method to clear page-specific sessions

### 2. Page Context Integration
**Modified Files:**
- `src/pages/NFL.tsx`
- `src/pages/CollegeFootball.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `pageId` prop to `MiniWagerBotChat` component:
  - NFL page: `pageId="nfl"`
  - College Football page: `pageId="college-football"`
- Added `useAuth()` hook to access current user
- Imported `chatSessionManager` to handle session clearing

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging
**Added comprehensive console logging for:**

#### Context Generation (in both pages):
```javascript
console.log('📊 CFB Context Generated:', {
  length: context.length,
  gameCount: predictions.length,
  preview: context.substring(0, 300) + '...',
  fullContext: context // Full context for debugging
});
```

#### Session Management:
- `✅ Found existing session for page: [pageId]`
- `❌ No existing session found for page: [pageId]`
- `🆕 Created new session: [sessionId] for page: [pageId]`
- `💾 Set current session for page [pageId]: [sessionId]`

#### Thread Creation:
- `📝 Creating NEW thread with system context (context changed or first time)`
- `📊 Context preview: [first 200 chars]...`
- `✅ Thread created successfully with page-specific context`
- `⏭️ Skipping thread creation - already initialized with this context`

### 4. Refresh Button Enhancement
**Both pages now:**
1. **Clear page-specific session** when refresh button is clicked
2. **Log full context data** to console for debugging

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  // Force new chat session on refresh
  console.log('🔄 Refresh triggered - clearing chat session to force new context');
  if (user) {
    chatSessionManager.clearPageSession(user.id, 'nfl'); // or 'college-football'
  }
  
  // ... rest of fetch logic
}
```

### 5. Context Tracking in ChatKitWrapper
**Added state to track initialized context:**
```javascript
const [initializedContext, setInitializedContext] = React.useState<string | null>(null);
```

This ensures:
- New thread is created only when context actually changes
- Prevents duplicate thread creation
- Forces new thread when switching pages (since context changes)

## How It Works Now

### Page-Specific Sessions
1. **NFL Page**: Creates and maintains its own chat session with NFL game data
2. **College Football Page**: Creates and maintains its own chat session with CFB game data
3. Each page's session is stored separately in localStorage

### Switching Pages
1. When you navigate from NFL → CFB (or vice versa):
   - The old page's session remains in localStorage
   - New page checks for its own session
   - If none exists, creates a new session with current page data
   - ChatKit creates a new thread with the new page's context

### Refreshing Data
1. Click the Refresh button
2. Session for current page is cleared
3. New data is fetched
4. When chat is opened again, a new session is created with fresh data
5. Full context is logged to console for debugging

## Testing & Debugging

### Console Output to Look For:

**When opening chat on NFL page:**
```
📊 MiniWagerBotChat pageContext length: 5234
📄 MiniWagerBotChat pageId: nfl
🏈 NFL Context Generated: { length: 5234, gameCount: 16, ... }
🆕 Creating new session for page: nfl
💾 Set current session for page nfl: session_1234567890_abc123
📝 Creating NEW thread with system context
✅ Thread created successfully with page-specific context
```

**When switching to CFB page:**
```
🔄 Page changed, clearing session to force new thread
📊 MiniWagerBotChat pageContext length: 6789
📄 MiniWagerBotChat pageId: college-football
📊 CFB Context Generated: { length: 6789, gameCount: 25, ... }
🆕 Creating new session for page: college-football
💾 Set current session for page college-football: session_1234567891_def456
📝 Creating NEW thread with system context
✅ Thread created successfully with page-specific context
```

**When clicking Refresh:**
```
🔄 Refresh triggered - clearing chat session to force new context
🗑️ Clearing session for page: nfl, sessionId: session_1234567890_abc123
✅ Page session cleared successfully for: nfl
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Accurate Context**: Each page now has its own chat context with relevant game data
2. ✅ **Clean Separation**: NFL and CFB chats are completely independent
3. ✅ **Fresh Data**: Refreshing data also refreshes the chat context
4. ✅ **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive logging to track context flow
5. ✅ **No Stale Data**: Old conversations don't carry over to new pages

## Files Modified

1. `/src/utils/chatSession.ts` - Session management logic
2. `/src/components/MiniWagerBotChat.tsx` - Page-specific session handling
3. `/src/components/ChatKitWrapper.tsx` - Context tracking and thread creation
4. `/src/pages/NFL.tsx` - NFL page integration
5. `/src/pages/CollegeFootball.tsx` - CFB page integration

## Next Steps

1. Open browser console
2. Navigate to NFL page
3. Click the chat button
4. Observe the console logs showing context being passed
5. Switch to College Football page
6. Click the chat button again
7. Verify new context is being used
8. Click Refresh button
9. Verify session is cleared and new context is loaded
