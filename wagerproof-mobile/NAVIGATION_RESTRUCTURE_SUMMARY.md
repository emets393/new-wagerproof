## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow
```
Feed Screen
  ├── NFL Games: nfl_predictions_epa + nfl_betting_lines + production_betting_facts_nfl
  └── CFB Games: cfb_live_weekly_inputs + cfb_api_predictions

Live Scores
  ├── live_scores table (is_live = true)
  ├── Enriched with NFL predictions (nfl_predictions_epa + nfl_betting_lines)
  └── Enriched with CFB predictions (cfb_live_weekly_inputs + cfb_api_predictions)

Editor's Picks
  ├── editors_picks table (is_published = true)
  ├── NFL game data: nfl_betting_lines
  └── CFB game data: cfb_live_weekly_inputs
```

### Search Implementation
```typescript
const filteredGames = games.filter(game =>
  game.home_team.toLowerCase().includes(searchText.toLowerCase()) ||
  game.away_team.toLowerCase().includes(searchText.toLowerCase())
);
```

### Sort Modes
1. **Time**: Sort by game_date ascending
2. **Spread**: 
   - NFL: Sort by spread probability (highest confidence)
   - CFB: Sort by home_spread_diff (highest edge)
3. **O/U**: 
   - NFL: Sort by O/U probability (highest confidence)
   - CFB: Sort by over_line_diff (highest edge)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Feed screen loads NFL games
- [ ] Feed screen loads CFB games
- [ ] Sport pill selection switches between sports
- [ ] Search filters games correctly
- [ ] Sort by Time orders games chronologically
- [ ] Sort by Spread orders by edge/probability
- [ ] Sort by O/U orders by edge/probability
- [ ] Live ticker appears when games are live
- [ ] Live ticker shows prediction status
- [ ] Editor's Picks loads and displays
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh works on all screens

- [ ] Navigation between tabs works

## Future Enhancements

### Chat Tab

- Add context injection based on selected sport
- Implement streamed AI responses
- Add conversation history

### Picks Tab
- Admin mode for creating/editing picks (web-only for now)
- Push notifications for new picks
- Filtering by sport

### Feed Tab
- Add weather display to cards
- Add betting splits display
- Team logos (requires mapping)
- Advanced filters (conference, date range)

### Live Scores

- Filter by league

### Settings

## Performance Considerations

- Live scores refresh every 2 minutes (configurable)
- Game data cached until manual refresh
- FlatList for efficient rendering of large game lists
- Memoized sorting and filtering operations
- Lazy loading for Editor's Picks game data

## Notes

- CFB screen (`app/(tabs)/cfb.tsx`) was updated with correct data fetching but kept separate
- The plan was to remove it, but it provides a dedicated CFB experience with additional features
- Both the unified Feed and dedicated CFB screen can coexist
- All linting passes without errors
- No TypeScript errors
