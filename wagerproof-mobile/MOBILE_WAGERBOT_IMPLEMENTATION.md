# Mobile WagerBot Chat Implementation - Complete ✅

## Overview

Successfully implemented the mobile WagerBot chat feature for the React Native app. The chat replaces the "Coming Soon" screen and provides AI-powered sports betting analysis with full access to NFL and CFB game data, predictions, and betting lines.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Dependencies Installed ✅
- `react-native-chatgpt` - Chat UI library (installed via npm)

### 2. New Files Created ✅

#### `/wagerproof-mobile/services/gameDataService.ts`
Service that handles fetching and formatting game data for AI context:
- `fetchNFLPredictions()` - Fetches NFL data from `nfl_predictions_epa` and `nfl_betting_lines` tables
- `fetchCFBPredictions()` - Fetches CFB data from `cfb_live_weekly_inputs` and `cfb_api_predictions` tables
- `formatNFLContext()` - Formats NFL data as markdown
- `formatCFBContext()` - Formats CFB data as markdown
- `fetchAndFormatGameContext()` - Main function that fetches all data and returns formatted context

**Data Included in Context:**
- Team names and matchups
- Game date/time
- Betting lines (spread, moneyline, over/under)
- Model predictions (ML probability, spread cover probability, O/U probability)
- Predicted scores (CFB only)
- Weather data (temperature, wind speed)
- Public betting splits

#### `/wagerproof-mobile/utils/chatSessionManager.ts`
Session management and BuildShip API integration:
- Session CRUD operations using AsyncStorage
- `getClientSecret()` - Calls BuildShip endpoint with game context as instructions
- Thread ID management for conversation continuity
- Page-specific session support

**BuildShip Integration:**
- Endpoint: `https://xna68l.buildship.run/chatKitSessionGenerator-2fc1c5152ebf`
- Workflow ID: `wf_68ed847d7a44819095f0e8eca93bfd660fc4b093b131f0f0`
- Passes game context as `instructions` parameter
- Handles 15-second timeout
- Supports multiple response formats

#### `/wagerproof-mobile/components/WagerBotChat.tsx`
Main chat UI component:
- Full-featured chat interface with message bubbles
- Real-time streaming response support
- Loading and error states
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Theme integration (dark/light mode)
- Keyboard handling
- Auto-scroll to bottom
- Message history display

**Features:**
- Welcome message on first load
- Context-aware AI responses
- Visual distinction between user and bot messages
- Bot icon for assistant messages
- Character limit (500 chars per message)
- Disabled state while sending
- Error recovery with retry

### 3. Files Modified ✅

#### `/wagerproof-mobile/app/(tabs)/chat.tsx`
Completely replaced "Coming Soon" screen with functional chat:
- Fetches game context on mount
- Passes context to WagerBotChat component
- Shows loading states
- Displays context errors as warnings (non-blocking)
- Integrates with AuthContext for user data

#### `/wagerproof-mobile/package.json`
- Added `react-native-chatgpt` dependency

## Architecture Flow

```
1. User opens Chat tab
   ↓
2. chat.tsx loads
   ↓
3. Fetch game data (gameDataService)
   ↓

8. Receive client secret
   ↓
9. Display welcome message
   ↓
10. User sends message
   ↓
11. POST to BuildShip chat endpoint
   ↓
12. Stream response back to UI
   ↓
13. Display in chat bubble
```

## BuildShip Configuration Required

### Current Setup (From Web Implementation)
The BuildShip workflow is already configured from the web implementation. It should:

1. **Accept these parameters:**
   ```json
   {
     "userId": "user_id",
     "userEmail": "user@email.com",
     "workflowId": "wf_68ed847d7a44819095f0e8eca93bfd660fc4b093b131f0f0",
     "timestamp": "ISO timestamp",
     "stream": true,
     "instructions": "Full game context markdown string"
   }
   ```

2. **Return client secret:**
   ```json
   {
     "client_secret": "cs_...",
     "agent_id": "agent_..."
   }
   ```

### Chat Endpoint Configuration

**IMPORTANT:** You need to ensure your BuildShip has a chat message endpoint at:
```
https://xna68l.buildship.run/chat
```

This endpoint should:

1. **Accept these parameters:**
   ```json
   {
     "message": "User's message",
     "threadId": "thread_id (optional)",
     "timestamp": "ISO timestamp",
     "userId": "user_id",
     "userEmail": "user@email.com"
   }
   ```

2. **Return either:**
   - **Streaming response:** Plain text chunks that aggregate to the full message
   - **JSON response:**
     ```json
     {
       "message": "AI's response",
       "threadId": "thread_id"
     }
     ```

3. **Optional Thread ID methods:**
   - Via response header: `x-thread-id` (remember to set `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`)
   - Via stream: Append `\x1f` + threadId after the message
   - Via JSON: Include `threadId` field

### If Chat Endpoint Doesn't Exist

If you don't have a chat endpoint yet, you have two options:

#### Option A: Use BuildShip's OpenAI Assistant API Template
1. Clone the "OpenAI Assistant Chat" template in BuildShip
2. Configure it to use your OpenAI API key
3. Set up the endpoint to accept the parameters above
4. The `instructions` from the session creation will be used as the system prompt

#### Option B: Use OpenAI ChatKit API Directly
The `WagerBotChat.tsx` component can be modified to use OpenAI's API directly if you have the proper authentication set up. However, this requires exposing API keys, which is not recommended for mobile apps.

## Game Context Format

The AI receives game data in this format:

```markdown
# 🏈 NFL Games Data

I have access to **X NFL games** with complete betting lines, model predictions, weather data, and public betting splits.

### Game 1: Away Team @ Home Team

**Date/Time:** MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM

**Betting Lines:**
- Spread: Home Team -X.X
- Moneyline: Away +XXX / Home -XXX
- Over/Under: XX.X

**Model Predictions (EPA Model):**
- ML Probability: XX.X%
- Spread Cover Probability: XX.X%
- O/U Probability: XX.X%

**Weather:** XX°F, Wind: XX mph

**Public Betting Splits:**
- Spread: XX% on away
- Total: XX% on over
- Moneyline: XX% on away

# 🏈 College Football Games Data

[Similar format for CFB games]
```

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying, test the following:

- [ ] Chat screen loads without errors
- [ ] Game data fetches successfully (check console logs)
- [ ] BuildShip client secret is obtained
- [ ] Welcome message appears
- [ ] User can send messages
- [ ] AI responses are received and displayed
- [ ] Streaming responses work correctly
- [ ] Thread ID is maintained across messages
- [ ] Error handling works (network errors, API errors)
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh updates game context
- [ ] Theme (dark/light) is applied correctly
- [ ] Keyboard behavior is correct
- [ ] Auto-scroll works
- [ ] Messages persist during session

## Console Logs to Monitor

The implementation includes extensive logging:

```
🔄 Loading game context for WagerBot...
📊 Fetched X NFL predictions with lines
📊 Fetched X CFB predictions
✅ Game context generated: XXXX characters
📊 Total games: X NFL + X CFB
🔄 Initializing WagerBot chat...
📝 Session created: session_xxx
🔑 Calling BuildShip workflow for client secret...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📤 SENDING GAME CONTEXT TO BUILDSHIP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Client secret extracted successfully
✅ Chat initialized successfully
📤 Sending message to BuildShip...
🔗 Thread ID set from [header/stream/JSON]: thread_xxx
✅ Message received successfully
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to initialize chat"
**Solution:** Check BuildShip endpoint is accessible and returning client secret

### Issue: "API request failed"
**Solution:** Verify the chat endpoint URL is correct and BuildShip workflow is deployed

### Issue: No game context loaded
**Solution:** Check Supabase tables have data and credentials are correct

### Issue: Messages not sending
**Solution:** Check network connectivity and BuildShip chat endpoint configuration

### Issue: Streaming not working
**Solution:** Verify BuildShip returns proper streaming response format

## Next Steps / Enhancements

Optional improvements for future iterations:

1. **Session Persistence:** Save/restore full conversation history
2. **Context Updates:** Refresh game data periodically during chat
3. **Rich Messages:** Support for formatted responses (tables, lists)
4. **Voice Input:** Add speech-to-text for voice messages
5. **Favorites:** Save/bookmark useful AI responses
6. **Share:** Export chat conversations
7. **Typing Indicators:** Show when AI is "typing"
8. **Message Actions:** Copy, delete, regenerate responses
9. **Offline Support:** Queue messages when offline
10. **Push Notifications:** Notify users of new insights

## Security Considerations

- Client secrets are fetched per session and not stored persistently
- User authentication required via AuthContext
- All API calls go through BuildShip (server-side OpenAI calls)
- No API keys exposed in mobile app
- AsyncStorage used for session data (local device only)

## Performance Notes

- Game data limited to 20 games max to manage token count
- Streaming responses for better perceived performance
- Lazy loading of game context (only fetched when needed)
- Efficient React Native rendering with proper memo/callback usage
- AsyncStorage for fast local session management
