# Mobile WagerBot Chat - Image Upload Feature ‚úÖ

## Overview

Successfully implemented image upload capability for the mobile WagerBot chat. Users can now attach images (e.g., bet slips, game screenshots) to their messages and send them to WagerBot for analysis.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Dependencies Added ‚úÖ

- `expo-image-picker` - For selecting images from device photo library
- `expo-file-system` - For file system operations (already available via Expo)

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install expo-image-picker expo-file-system
```

### 2. Imports Added to WagerBotChat.tsx ‚úÖ

```typescript
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system';
import { Image } from 'react-native';  // For image preview
```

### 3. New State Variables ‚úÖ

```typescript
// Image attachment state
const [selectedImages, setSelectedImages] = useState<Array<{ uri: string; base64: string; name: string }>>([]);
const [isPickingImage, setIsPickingImage] = useState(false);
```

### 4. New Functions ‚úÖ

#### `handlePickImage()`
- Requests media library permissions from user
- Opens image picker
- Converts selected image to base64 format
- Stores image with URI, base64, and filename
- Provides haptic feedback on successful selection
- Handles errors gracefully with user alerts

#### `handleRemoveImage(index)`
- Allows users to remove selected images before sending
- Updates UI in real-time

### 5. UI Components Added ‚úÖ

#### Image Preview Section
- Displays selected images in a horizontal scrollable list
- Shows thumbnail previews (40x40px)
- Each image has a remove button (X icon)
- Located above the input container
- Only visible when images are selected

#### Updated Attachment Button
- Changed icon from "plus" to "image-plus"
- Added loading state with activity indicator
- Disabled during image picking or message sending
- Calls `handlePickImage()` on press
- Provides visual feedback

#### Updated Send Button
- Now allows sending messages with images but no text
- Updated disabled state: `(!inputText.trim() && selectedImages.length === 0) || isSending`
- Send button activates when either text or images are present

#### Updated Text Input
- Placeholder text changes to "Add a message with your image..." when images selected
- Otherwise shows "Chat with WagerBot"

### 6. Message Sending Updated ‚úÖ

#### Updated `sendMessage()` Function
```typescript
const sendMessage = async () => {
  if ((!inputText.trim() && selectedImages.length === 0) || isSending) return;
  await sendMessageWithText(inputText.trim());
};
```

#### Updated `sendMessageWithText()` Function
- Stores selected images before clearing input
- Clears selected images after sending (resets UI)
- Includes images in the request body to BuildShip:

```typescript
if (imagesToSend.length > 0) {
  requestBody.images = imagesToSend.map(img => ({
    base64: img.base64,
    name: img.name,
  }));
  console.log(`üì∏ Including ${imagesToSend.length} image(s)`);
}
```

### 7. CSS/StyleSheet Updates ‚úÖ

New styles added for image preview UI:

```typescript
attachButtonDisabled: {
  opacity: 0.7,
},
imagePreviewContainer: {
  flexDirection: 'row',
  marginBottom: 8,
  paddingHorizontal: 8,
  paddingVertical: 4,
  backgroundColor: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.05)',
  borderRadius: 12,
},
imagePreviewScroll: {
  flexDirection: 'row',
},
imagePreviewItem: {
  width: 40,
  height: 40,
  borderRadius: 8,
  marginRight: 8,
  position: 'relative',
},
imagePreview: {
  width: '100%',
  height: '100%',
  borderRadius: 8,
},
imageRemoveButton: {
  position: 'absolute',
  top: -5,
  right: -5,
  backgroundColor: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)',
  borderRadius: 10,
  width: 20,
  height: 20,
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
},
```

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Select Images:**
   - User taps the "image-plus" button in the input area
   - Image picker opens (camera roll / photo library)
   - User selects one or more images
   - Images appear as thumbnails in preview area

2. **Manage Selection:**
   - User can see all selected images in horizontal scroll
   - Each image has a remove (X) button
   - Tapping X removes that image from selection

3. **Add Message (Optional):**
   - User can type a message to accompany the image(s)
   - Placeholder text updates to reflect image attachment
   - Send button activates when text OR images are present

4. **Send Message:**
   - User taps send button
   - Message + images sent to BuildShip API
   - Images included as base64 in request body
   - UI clears (selected images removed, input cleared)
   - Thinking indicator appears while processing

### Technical Details

#### Image Handling
- **Format:** Base64 encoded
- **Quality:** 80% (optimized for faster transmission)
- **Metadata:** Filename included for BuildShip processing
- **Storage:** Only in state (not persisted to device)

#### Permissions
- App requests media library access on first image pick attempt
- iOS/Android permission dialogs shown to user
- User can allow/deny access

#### Validation
- Only image files accepted (`MediaTypeOptions.Images`)
- Error handling for permission denial
- User-friendly error alerts

#### BuildShip Integration
Images sent in request body format:
```json
{
  "message": "user message text",
  "images": [
    {
      "base64": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAAB...",
      "name": "image_1729689001234.jpg"
    }
  ],
  "conversationHistory": [...],
  "SystemPrompt": "..."
}
```

BuildShip endpoint can process images for:
- Bet slip analysis/grading
- Game screenshot analysis
- Sports betting image recognition

## Testing Checklist

  - Verify response appears below

- [ ] **Image-Only Message:**
  - Select image without text
  - Verify send button is active
  - Send with only image
  - Verify works correctly

- [ ] **UI Updates:**

  - Switch pages with images selected

## Console Logging

The implementation includes detailed console logs for debugging:

```
üì∏ Attached images: 1
üì∏ Including 1 image(s)
üì∏ Included in request payload
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multiple Image Selection:**
   - Allow selecting multiple images at once
   - Current: One image at a time added sequentially

2. **Image Compression:**
   - Further optimize large images
   - Reduce base64 payload size

3. **Camera Capture:**
   - Add ability to capture images with device camera
   - Useful for bet slip photos

4. **Image Editing:**
   - Crop/rotate images before sending
   - Annotation tools

5. **Image Gallery:**
   - Show recent images sent
   - Reuse/resend previous bet slip images

6. **Progress Indicator:**
   - Show upload progress for large images
   - Display estimated time remaining

## Files Modified

- `wagerproof-mobile/components/WagerBotChat.tsx` - Main component with all image upload logic
- `wagerproof-mobile/package.json` - Added dependencies

## Compatibility

- **iOS:** ‚úÖ Fully supported via `expo-image-picker`
- **Android:** ‚úÖ Fully supported via `expo-image-picker`
- **Web:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited support (expo-image-picker has web support but limited)

## Troubleshooting

### Image Picker Doesn't Open
- Check permissions are granted
- Verify device has photo library access
- Check device storage isn't full

### Images Not Sending
- Verify BuildShip endpoint accepts `images` parameter
- Check console logs for image base64 payload
- Verify network connection

### Large Image Performance
- Consider adding image size validation
- Implement progressive quality reduction
- Consider file size limits

## Notes

- Images are stored in component state only (not persisted)
- Base64 conversion happens on-device
- No server-side image storage needed
- BuildShip receives images and can process/analyze them
