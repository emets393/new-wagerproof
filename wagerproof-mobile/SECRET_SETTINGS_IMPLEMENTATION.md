# Secret Settings Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added a hidden "Secret Settings" page accessible by double-tapping the App Version in settings. This page contains developer tools and testing utilities.

## Implementation Complete ✅

### 1. Secret Settings Page (`app/(modals)/secret-settings.tsx`)

A dedicated page for developer and testing options that includes:

#### Developer Options
- **Use Dummy Data Toggle**
  - Moved from main settings to secret settings
  - Controls whether to show dummy data or live API data
  - Uses SettingsContext for state management

#### Testing Tools
- **Reset Onboarding Button**
  - Allows developers/testers to re-enter the onboarding flow
  - Updates Supabase: sets `onboarding_completed = false` and clears `onboarding_data`
  - Shows confirmation dialog before resetting
  - Automatically redirects to onboarding flow after reset
  - Perfect for testing the complete onboarding experience

#### Build Information
- App Version (1.0.0)
- Build Environment (Development/Production)
- User ID (for debugging)

### 2. Updated Main Settings (`app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`)

#### Double-Tap Detection
- Added tap counting state and timer
- App Version item now has `onPress` handler
- Detects double-tap within 500ms window
- Opens secret settings modal on double-tap
- Timer auto-resets after 500ms to prevent accidental triggers
- Cleanup on component unmount

#### Changes Made
- Removed "Developer Options" section from main settings
- Removed "Use Dummy Data" toggle from main view
- Added double-tap functionality to "App Version" item
- Added tap count state and timer management

### User Flow

#### Accessing Secret Settings
1. User opens Settings tab
2. Scrolls to "About" section
3. **Double-taps** on "App Version"
4. Secret Settings modal opens

#### Testing Onboarding
1. User opens Secret Settings
2. Taps "Reset Onboarding"
3. Confirms the action in dialog
4. System updates database
5. Success alert shows
6. User taps OK
7. Redirects to onboarding flow
8. User goes through all 16 steps again

### Code Changes

#### New Files
- `app/(modals)/secret-settings.tsx` - Secret settings screen

#### Modified Files
- `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` - Added double-tap detection, removed developer section

### Key Features

#### Security
- Hidden from normal users (requires knowledge of double-tap)
- No visible indication in UI
- Only accessible to those who know the secret

#### Developer Experience
- Quick access to testing tools
- Easy onboarding flow testing
- Dummy data toggle for development
- User ID display for debugging

#### Safety
- Confirmation dialogs before destructive actions
- Clear messaging about what will happen
- Graceful error handling
- Automatic navigation after reset

### Technical Details

#### Double-Tap Implementation
```typescript
const [tapCount, setTapCount] = React.useState(0);
const tapTimer = React.useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);

const handleVersionTap = () => {
  setTapCount(prev => prev + 1);
  
  if (tapTimer.current) {
    clearTimeout(tapTimer.current);
  }
  
  tapTimer.current = setTimeout(() => {
    setTapCount(0);
  }, 500);
  
  if (tapCount + 1 >= 2) {
    setTapCount(0);
    router.push('/(modals)/secret-settings');
  }
};
```

#### Onboarding Reset
```typescript
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .update({
    onboarding_completed: false,
    onboarding_data: null,
  })
  .eq('user_id', user.id);

// Then navigate to onboarding
router.replace('/(onboarding)');
```

### Testing Checklist

- [x] Double-tap opens secret settings
- [x] Single tap doesn't open secret settings
- [x] Dummy data toggle works
- [x] Reset onboarding button shows confirmation
- [x] Reset onboarding updates database
- [x] Reset onboarding redirects to onboarding flow
- [x] User can complete onboarding again after reset
- [x] Build info displays correctly
- [x] Close button works

- [x] No linter errors

### Usage Instructions

#### For Developers
1. Build and run the app
2. Navigate to Settings
3. Double-tap "App Version"
4. Access developer tools

#### For Testing Onboarding
1. Open Secret Settings (double-tap app version)
2. Tap "Reset Onboarding"
3. Confirm the action
4. Complete the onboarding flow
5. Verify all 16 steps work correctly
6. Verify data saves to Supabase
7. Verify user redirects to main app after completion

### Benefits

✅ **Easy Testing** - Quickly test onboarding without database manipulation
✅ **Hidden from Users** - No clutter in main settings
✅ **Safe** - Confirmation dialogs prevent accidents
✅ **Developer Friendly** - All dev tools in one place
✅ **Discoverable** - Simple gesture (double-tap) to access
✅ **Professional** - Clean implementation with proper error handling

### Future Enhancements

Potential additions to secret settings:
- Clear cache button
- Force crash for testing error handling
- Network request logger
- API endpoint switcher (dev/staging/prod)
- Feature flags toggle
- Performance metrics viewer
- Database query tester
- Push notification tester

## Notes

- The double-tap detection uses a 500ms window

- Modal automatically closes when resetting onboarding
- 300ms delay between modal close and navigation ensures smooth transition
- All actions log to console for debugging
- Error handling with user-friendly alerts
