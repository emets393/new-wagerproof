# Supabase Chat Thread Storage Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented cloud-based chat thread storage using Supabase, replacing AsyncStorage with proper database persistence. The system now stores all chat conversations with AI-generated titles, enabling users to view and access their chat history across devices.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`supabase/migrations/create_chat_tables.sql`)

Created two main tables with proper relationships and security:

**`chat_threads` table:**
- `id` (UUID) - Primary key
- `user_id` (TEXT) - User identifier
- `title` (TEXT) - AI-generated conversation title
- `openai_thread_id` (TEXT) - OpenAI conversation ID
- `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last activity timestamp
- `message_count` - Number of messages in thread

**`chat_messages` table:**
- `id` (UUID) - Primary key
- `thread_id` (UUID) - Foreign key to chat_threads
- `role` (TEXT) - 'user' or 'assistant'
- `content` (TEXT) - Message text
- `created_at` - Message timestamp

**Features:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user isolation
- Automatic timestamp updates via triggers
- Automatic message count updates
- Cascade delete (deleting thread removes all messages)
- Indexed for fast queries

### 2. Chat Thread Service (`services/chatThreadService.ts`)

New service layer for all Supabase chat operations:

**Core Methods:**
- `createThread(userId, firstMessage, openaiThreadId)` - Create new thread
- `updateThreadTitle(threadId, title)` - Update AI-generated title
- `updateOpenAIThreadId(threadId, openaiThreadId)` - Link OpenAI thread
- `saveMessage(threadId, role, content)` - Add message to thread
- `getThreads(userId)` - Fetch all user threads (sorted by recent)
- `getThread(threadId)` - Get specific thread with all messages
- `updateThreadActivity(threadId)` - Update last active timestamp
- `deleteThread(threadId)` - Remove thread and messages
- `generateThreadTitle(threadId, userMsg, assistantMsg)` - AI title generation

**AI Title Generation:**
- Uses OpenAI API to generate concise 3-5 word titles
- Triggered after first message exchange
- Runs asynchronously (non-blocking)
- Falls back to default title on failure

### 3. Session Manager Updates (`utils/chatSessionManager.ts`)

Refactored to use Supabase instead of AsyncStorage:

**Updated Methods:**
- `getUserSessions()` - Fetches threads from Supabase
- `getCurrentSession()` - Loads thread from Supabase
- `createNewSession()` - Creates thread in Supabase
- `saveSession()` - Updates thread activity
- `deleteSession()` - Removes thread from Supabase
- `clearUserSessions()` - Bulk delete user threads

**Preserved:**
- BuildShip client secret generation
- AsyncStorage for current session tracking (local state only)
- Session ID management

### 4. WagerBot Chat Updates (`components/WagerBotChat.tsx`)

Modified to persist all chat interactions to Supabase:

**Changes:**

1. **Import chatThreadService:**
   ```typescript
   import { chatThreadService } from '../services/chatThreadService';
   ```

2. **Updated `loadChatHistories()`:**
   - Fetches threads from Supabase
   - Shows AI-generated titles
   - Sorts by most recent activity

3. **Updated `switchToChat()`:**
   - Loads thread with all messages from Supabase
   - Properly converts message format
   - Sets OpenAI thread ID for continuity

4. **Modified `sendMessage()` - In `xhr.onload` handler:**
   - Creates Supabase thread on first message
   - Saves user and assistant messages
   - Updates OpenAI thread ID
   - Triggers AI title generation asynchronously
   - All operations non-blocking for smooth UX

## How It Works

### New Conversation Flow

```
1. User opens WagerBot
   ↓
2. Creates session (createNewSession)
   ↓
3. Creates thread in Supabase (no title yet)
   ↓
4. User sends first message
   ↓
5. BuildShip processes with OpenAI
   ↓
6. Real-time streaming displays response
   ↓
7. After complete:
   - Save user message to Supabase
   - Save assistant message to Supabase
   - Update OpenAI thread ID
   - Generate AI title (async)
   ↓
8. Future messages saved to same thread
```

### Continuing Conversation Flow

```
1. User opens history drawer
   ↓
2. Loads all threads from Supabase
   ↓
3. Shows titles (AI-generated or default)
   ↓
4. User taps a thread
   ↓
5. Loads thread with all messages from Supabase
   ↓
6. Sets OpenAI thread ID for continuity
   ↓
7. User can continue conversation
   ↓
8. New messages saved to existing thread
```

### AI Title Generation Flow

```
1. First message exchange completes
   ↓
2. Async call to OpenAI API
   ↓
3. Prompt: "Generate 3-5 word title"
   ↓
4. GPT-3.5 generates concise title
   ↓
5. Update thread title in Supabase
   ↓
6. Title appears in history drawer
```

## Database Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Migration

In your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to **SQL Editor**
2. Click **New Query**
3. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/create_chat_tables.sql`
4. Paste and click **Run**

Or via Supabase CLI:

```bash
cd wagerproof-mobile
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Verify Tables

Check that tables were created:

```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT * FROM chat_threads LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM chat_messages LIMIT 1;

-- Check indexes
SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename IN ('chat_threads', 'chat_messages');

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename IN ('chat_threads', 'chat_messages');
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment

Ensure your `.env` has Supabase credentials:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key  # For title generation
```

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Create New Thread
- [ ] Start new chat
- [ ] Send first message
- [ ] Verify thread created in Supabase
- [ ] Verify messages saved
- [ ] Wait 2-3 seconds for AI title
- [ ] Refresh history - see new title

### ✅ Continue Existing Thread
- [ ] Send additional messages
- [ ] Verify messages saved to correct thread
- [ ] Check `updated_at` timestamp updates
- [ ] Check `message_count` increments

### ✅ Load Chat History
- [ ] Open history drawer
- [ ] Verify all threads listed
- [ ] Verify titles display (not "New Chat")
- [ ] Verify sorted by most recent

### ✅ Switch Between Threads
- [ ] Tap thread in history
- [ ] Verify all messages load
- [ ] Verify can continue conversation
- [ ] Switch to different thread
- [ ] Verify context switches correctly

### ✅ AI Title Generation
- [ ] Send first message
- [ ] Wait 2-3 seconds
- [ ] Check Supabase - title should update
- [ ] Reload history - title appears

### ✅ OpenAI Thread Continuity
- [ ] Start conversation
- [ ] Send multiple messages
- [ ] Verify OpenAI maintains context
- [ ] Check `openai_thread_id` in Supabase
- [ ] Switch away and back
- [ ] Context preserved

### ✅ Delete Thread
- [ ] Delete thread from UI (if implemented)
- [ ] Verify removed from Supabase

## Queries for Debugging

### View All Threads for User

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  user_id,
  title,
  openai_thread_id,
  message_count,
  created_at,
  updated_at
FROM chat_threads
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

### View Messages in Thread

```sql
SELECT 
  m.role,
  m.content,
  m.created_at,
  t.title as thread_title
FROM chat_messages m
JOIN chat_threads t ON t.id = m.thread_id
WHERE m.thread_id = 'THREAD_ID'
ORDER BY m.created_at ASC;
```

### Check Title Generation

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  message_count,
  created_at
FROM chat_threads
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
  AND message_count >= 2
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Find Threads Without Titles

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  user_id,
  openai_thread_id,
  message_count,
  created_at
FROM chat_threads
WHERE title IS NULL
  AND message_count >= 2;
```

**Solution:** Check Supabase connection. Verify foreign key constraints.

### Issue: "Old messages not showing"
**Solution:** Verify thread ID matches. Check `getThread()` query.
