# React Native Migration Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

### Completed Tasks

#### 1.1 Initialize Expo Project ✅
- Created new Expo project with TypeScript (`wagerproof-mobile`)
- Installed Expo Router for file-based navigation
- Configured project structure following Expo Router conventions

#### 1.2 Install Core Dependencies ✅
- **UI Library**: React Native Paper + Vector Icons
- **Supabase**: @supabase/supabase-js + AsyncStorage
- **State Management**: @tanstack/react-query
- **Animations**: react-native-reanimated
- **Date handling**: date-fns + date-fns-tz
- **Web support**: react-native-web + react-dom
- **Charts**: Temporarily removed victory-native (worklets conflict - will add back later)

#### 1.3 Configure Project Structure ✅
Created complete folder structure:
```
wagerproof-mobile/
├── app/
│   ├── (tabs)/        # Bottom tab navigator
│   ├── (auth)/        # Auth screens (empty, ready for implementation)
│   ├── (modals)/      # Modal screens (empty, ready for implementation)
│   └── _layout.tsx    # Root layout with providers
├── components/
│   ├── ui/            # UI primitives (ready for components)
│   ├── game-cards/    # Game cards (ready for implementation)
│   ├── charts/        # Charts (ready for implementation)
│   └── navigation/    # Navigation components (ready)
├── contexts/
│   └── AuthContext.tsx  # Authentication context (complete)
├── services/
│   └── supabase.ts      # Supabase client (complete)
├── hooks/             # Custom hooks (ready)
├── utils/             # Utilities (ready)
├── constants/
│   └── theme.ts         # Theme configuration (complete)
└── types/             # TypeScript types (ready)
```

#### 1.4 Set Up Authentication ✅
- Created `AuthContext.tsx` adapted for React Native
- Uses AsyncStorage instead of localStorage
- Configured Supabase client for mobile
- OAuth flows ready (Google/Apple Sign In)
- **TODO**: Copy Supabase credentials from web app to .env file

#### 1.5 Theme & Styling Setup ✅
- Configured React Native Paper theme with honeydew green brand colors
- Set up dark mode support (automatic based on system)
- Created theme constants (spacing, typography, layout)
- Light and dark themes match web app design

### Tab Screens Created

1. **Home (index.tsx)** ✅
   - Welcome screen with feature cards
   - Links to main features
   - Beautiful Material Design layout

2. **NFL (nfl.tsx)** ✅
   - Placeholder screen ready for implementation
   - Lists key features to be implemented

3. **College Football (cfb.tsx)** ✅
   - Placeholder screen ready for implementation
   - Lists key features to be implemented

4. **Scoreboard (scoreboard.tsx)** ✅
   - Placeholder screen with filter chips
   - Ready for live score implementation

5. **More (more.tsx)** ✅
   - Settings and account menu
   - Links to all secondary features
   - Sign out functionality

### Configuration Files Created

- `app.json` - Expo configuration with proper bundle IDs and plugins
- `package.json` - All dependencies configured
- `babel.config.js` - Babel configuration with Reanimated plugin
- `.gitignore` - Proper git ignore rules
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `constants/theme.ts` - Theme configuration
- `services/supabase.ts` - Supabase client setup

### Known Issues

1. **Victory Native Removed Temporarily**
   - Conflict with react-native-worklets babel plugin
   - Will add back when implementing charts
   - Alternative: Use react-native-chart-kit or recharts-native

2. **Environment Variables Needed**
   - Need to create `.env` file with Supabase credentials
   - Copy from web app:
     ```
     EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
     EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
     ```

## Next Steps - Phase 2: Core Navigation & Layout

### 2.1 Test the App
- [x] Start development server (`npm start`)
- [ ] Test on iOS simulator
- [ ] Test on Android emulator
- [ ] Test web version
- [ ] Verify all tabs navigate correctly

### 2.2 Add Environment Variables
- [ ] Create `.env` file
- [ ] Copy Supabase credentials from web app
- [ ] Test authentication flow

### 2.3 Create Auth Screens
- [ ] Login screen (`app/(auth)/login.tsx`)
- [ ] Signup screen (`app/(auth)/signup.tsx`)
- [ ] Password reset screen
- [ ] OAuth integration (Google/Apple)

### 2.4 Protected Routes
- [ ] Create ProtectedRoute component
- [ ] Add authentication guards to tabs
- [ ] Redirect to login if not authenticated

### 2.5 Drawer Navigation (Tablet/Web)
- [ ] Implement responsive drawer for larger screens
- [ ] Port sidebar structure from web app
- [ ] Make it responsive (drawer on tablet/web, tabs on mobile)

## Phase 3: Page Migration (Ready to Start)

Once Phase 2 is complete, we can begin migrating pages in priority order:

1. Account & Settings (CRITICAL)
2. NFL predictions (HIGH PRIORITY)
3. College Football predictions (HIGH PRIORITY)
4. Scoreboard with live scores (HIGH PRIORITY)
5. WagerBot Chat (HIGH PRIORITY)
6. Game Analysis details (HIGH PRIORITY)
7. Onboarding flow (MEDIUM)
8. Bet Slip Grader (MEDIUM)
9. NFL Analytics (MEDIUM)
10. Other features (LOW)

## Current Status

**Phase 1: COMPLETE** ✅

The foundation is solid and ready for building features. The app:
- Runs successfully with Expo Router
- Has proper theming and styling
- Has authentication context ready
- Has all 5 tab screens with placeholders
- Has proper project structure for scaling

**Next**: Complete Phase 2 (Navigation & Auth) and begin page migrations.
