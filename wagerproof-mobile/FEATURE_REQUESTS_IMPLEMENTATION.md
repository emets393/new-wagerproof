# Feature Requests Implementation - Mobile App

## Overview
The mobile app now includes a complete feature request system that mirrors the website's functionality, allowing users to submit, view, and vote on feature requests, as well as see the developer roadmap.

## What Was Created

### 1. Feature Requests Screen
**Location:** `/app/(tabs)/feature-requests.tsx`

A fully functional React Native screen that includes:

#### Features for Users:
- **Submit Feature Requests**: Users can submit new feature requests through a modal form
- **View Community Features**: See all approved feature requests from the community
- **Vote System**: Upvote or downvote feature requests to show support
- **Developer Roadmap**: View features in three stages:
  - üïê **Planned**: Features scheduled for development
  - üöÄ **In Progress**: Features currently being worked on
  - ‚úÖ **Completed**: Recently completed features

#### Key Components:
- **Beautiful Card Design**: Color-coded cards for different roadmap statuses
  - Blue for Planned
  - Purple for In Progress
  - Green for Completed
- **Vote Buttons**: Interactive upvote/downvote buttons with visual feedback
- **Submit Modal**: Bottom sheet modal for submitting new requests
- **Pull to Refresh**: Refresh the list by pulling down
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no requests exist

### 2. Navigation Integration
**Location:** `/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`

The feature requests screen is configured as a hidden tab:
- Not visible in the bottom tab bar
- Only accessible through the Settings page
- Uses `href: null` to hide from navigation while keeping it routable

The tab bar remains with 4 main tabs:
1. Feed
2. Chat
3. Picks
4. Settings

### 3. Settings Screen Update
**Location:** `/app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`

Updated the "Feature Requests" item in settings:
- **Before**: Opened email app to send feature request via email
- **After**: Navigates directly to the Feature Requests page
- **Access**: This is the ONLY way to access the feature requests page (not in main nav)

## User Experience Flow

### Submitting a Feature Request
1. User taps "Submit" button in the header
2. Bottom sheet modal appears with form fields:
   - Title (required)
   - Description (required)
3. User fills out the form and taps "Submit"
4. Request is submitted with "pending" status
5. Success message appears
6. Request will appear once approved by admin

### Voting on Features
1. User browses approved feature requests
2. Taps upvote üëç or downvote üëé button
3. Vote is instantly recorded and counts updated
4. User can change their vote or remove it by tapping again
5. Net vote count is displayed (upvotes - downvotes)

### Viewing Roadmap
1. User scrolls to "Developer Roadmap" section
2. Features are organized by status:
   - Planned items appear in blue
   - In Progress items appear in purple
   - Completed items appear in green
3. Each roadmap item shows total votes and submitter

## Database Integration

Uses existing Supabase tables from the website:
- **feature_requests**: Stores all feature requests
- **feature_request_votes**: Tracks user votes

### Automatic Features:
- Vote counts automatically update via database triggers
- Row Level Security (RLS) ensures users only see approved/roadmap items
- Users can only vote once per feature (enforced by unique constraint)

## Design Details

### Color Scheme
- **Primary Green**: `#22c55e` - Submit buttons, completed items, positive votes
- **Blue**: `#3b82f6` - Planned roadmap items
- **Purple**: `#a855f7` - In Progress roadmap items
- **Red**: `#ef4444` - Downvotes, negative votes
- **Yellow**: `#eab308` - Pending items (admin only, not visible to users)

### Responsive Design
- Works in both light and dark themes
- Adapts to safe areas (notches, home indicators)
- Bottom padding accounts for floating tab bar
- Modal keyboard avoidance for comfortable typing

### Accessibility
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Color-coded status indicators
- Icon + text labels for clarity
- Touch targets sized appropriately (minimum 44x44pt)

## No Admin Features

As requested, the mobile version does NOT include:
- ‚ùå Pending requests section (admin only on web)
- ‚ùå Approve/Reject buttons
- ‚ùå Move to Roadmap button
- ‚ùå Update Roadmap Status dropdown
- ‚ùå Remove from Roadmap button
- ‚ùå Admin mode toggle

Users can only:
- ‚úÖ Submit feature requests
- ‚úÖ View approved & roadmap features
- ‚úÖ Vote on community features
- ‚úÖ See vote counts

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Used
- `react-native` - Core UI components
- `react-native-paper` - Material Design components (Button, Divider)
- `@expo/vector-icons` - MaterialCommunityIcons
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Database integration
- `react-native-safe-area-context` - Safe area handling

### State Management
- Local state with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Auth context for user information
- Supabase realtime updates for vote counts

### Performance Optimizations
- `useCallback` for refresh function to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Conditional rendering to minimize component updates
- Efficient vote counting calculated on the fly

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. **Search/Filter**: Add ability to search or filter requests
2. **Categories**: Tag requests by category (UI, Features, Bug Fixes, etc.)
3. **Comments**: Allow users to comment on feature requests
4. **Notifications**: Notify users when their submitted feature is updated
5. **Sorting**: Sort by votes, date, status
6. **User Profile**: See all requests submitted by a user
