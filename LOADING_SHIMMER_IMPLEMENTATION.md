# Loading Shimmer Implementation âœ¨

## Overview
Replaced the loading icon with smooth, animated loading shimmers for the feed list objects. This provides a much better user experience by showing the structure of content that's about to load.

## What Changed

### 1. New Component: `GameCardShimmer`
**File**: `wagerproof-mobile/components/GameCardShimmer.tsx`

A skeleton loading component that mimics the structure of game cards with an animated gradient shimmer effect.

**Features**:
- âœ¨ Smooth animated gradient shimmer (1.5s cycle)
- ðŸŽ¨ Theme-aware colors (adapts to light/dark mode)
- ðŸ“± Matches the exact layout of actual game cards
- âš¡ 60fps native driver animations using Reanimated

**Components Animated**:
- Date and time skeleton
- Team circle avatars (away and home)
- Team names
- Betting lines
- O/U line pill
- Model prediction pills
- Public lean pills

### 2. Updated Feed Screen
**File**: `wagerproof-mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

Changed the loading state from a simple `ActivityIndicator` to a scrollable list of shimmer skeletons.

**Before**:
```tsx
{loading ? (
  <View style={[styles.centerContainer, { marginTop: TOTAL_COLLAPSIBLE_HEIGHT + 29 }]}>
    <ActivityIndicator size="large" color={theme.colors.primary} />
    <Text style={[styles.loadingText, { color: theme.colors.onSurfaceVariant }]}>
      Loading games...
    </Text>
  </View>
```

**After**:
```tsx
{loading ? (
  <Animated.FlatList
    data={Array(5).fill(null)}
    renderItem={() => <GameCardShimmer />}
    keyExtractor={(_, index) => `shimmer-${index}`}
    contentContainerStyle={[...]}
    scrollEventThrottle={16}
    bounces={false}
    overScrollMode="never"
    showsVerticalScrollIndicator={false}
    scrollEnabled={false}
  />
```

## How It Works

### Animation Flow
1. **Shimmer Animation**: Uses `react-native-reanimated` to create a smooth 1.5s looping animation
2. **Gradient Movement**: LinearGradient moves horizontally (-400 to 400) across the skeleton elements
3. **Theme Integration**: Automatically switches between light and dark mode colors
4. **Performance**: Uses native driver for 60fps smooth animations

### Color Schemes
- **Light Mode**: 
  - Base: `#f0f0f0`
  - Highlight: `#ffffff`
  
- **Dark Mode**:
  - Base: `#2a2a2a`
  - Highlight: `#3d3d3d`

## User Experience Benefits

âœ… **Better feedback** - User knows content is loading and sees expected structure
âœ… **Perceived faster loading** - Animated skeletons feel faster than static spinner
âœ… **Professional appearance** - Modern loading pattern used by Netflix, Instagram, etc.
âœ… **Responsive** - 5 skeleton cards shown during load, matching typical feed size
âœ… **Accessible** - Maintains collapsible header position and spacing

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Used
- `react-native-reanimated` - 60fps native animations
- `expo-linear-gradient` - Gradient shimmer effect
- `react-native-paper` - Theme integration

### Performance
- No performance impact - animations run on native thread
- Garbage collected immediately when actual data loads
- FlatList disabled scrolling during load (improves performance)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add skeleton loaders for other screens (scoreboard, chat, etc.)
2. Configurable skeleton count based on screen size
3. Skeleton loaders for details sheets
4. Skeleton loaders for individual prediction pills
5. Error state transitions with skeleton fade-out effect

## Testing

To see the shimmer loader in action:
1. Open the feed screen
2. Watch the skeleton loaders animate while data loads
3. Try toggling between NFL and CFB - the shimmer will appear for each sport
4. Try in both light and dark mode

The shimmer automatically disappears and transitions to actual game cards once data is loaded.
