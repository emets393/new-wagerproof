# Discord Editor's Picks Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Discord bot integration for automatically posting Editor's Picks to your private Discord server when they are published.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Frontend Integration ‚úÖ
**File Modified**: `src/components/EditorPickCard.tsx`

Added Discord posting logic to the `handlePublish` function that:
- Triggers after successful Supabase publish
- Sends formatted pick data to BuildShip workflow
- Handles errors gracefully (won't block publishing if Discord fails)
- Includes comprehensive logging for debugging

**Key Features**:
- Posts to the `editors-picks` channel (ID: 1428843931889569893)
- Sends all game data, odds, selected bets, and editor notes
- Includes team colors for dynamic embed styling
- Non-blocking implementation (Discord failure doesn't stop publish)

### 2. BuildShip Workflow Specification ‚úÖ
**File Created**: `DISCORD_BOT_BUILDSHIP_WORKFLOW.md`

Complete specification including:
- Workflow structure with 5 nodes
- Input/output schemas
- Full JavaScript code for formatting
- Discord API integration details
- Helper functions for bet display
- Error handling patterns
- Test payload for development
- Troubleshooting guide

## How It Works

### Discord Message Format
When a pick is published, Discord will show:
- üèà Title: "NEW EDITOR'S PICK"
- Team matchup (Away @ Home)
- Game date and time
- Selected bet types with odds
- Editor's analysis
- Team logos (away as thumbnail, home as main image)
- Dynamic color based on selected bet
- Footer with WagerBot branding

## Next Steps

### To Complete Setup:

1. **Create BuildShip Workflow**
   - Go to BuildShip dashboard
   - Create new workflow: `discord-editor-pick-post`
   - Follow instructions in `DISCORD_BOT_BUILDSHIP_WORKFLOW.md`
   - Copy the JavaScript code from the specification
   - Configure Discord API node with bot token
   - Deploy to production

2. **Test the Integration**
   - Publish a test Editor's Pick from the app
   - Check browser console for logs:
     - `üîî Posting to Discord...`
     - `‚úÖ Posted to Discord successfully`
   - Verify message appears in Discord #editors-picks channel
   - Test with different bet types (spread, moneyline, over/under)
   - Test with both NFL and CFB games

3. **Verify Discord Bot Permissions**
   - Ensure bot has "Send Messages" permission
   - Ensure bot has "Embed Links" permission
   - Ensure bot can access the #editors-picks channel

## Discord Bot Configuration

### Bot Details
- **Application ID**: 1428839983480832074
- **Server ID**: 1428416703175594209
- **Target Channel**: editors-picks (1428843931889569893)

### Required Permissions
- ‚úÖ Send Messages
- ‚úÖ Embed Links
- ‚úÖ Attach Files (for team logos)
- ‚úÖ Read Message History

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Single bet type (spread only)
- [ ] Single bet type (moneyline only)
- [ ] Single bet type (over/under only)
- [ ] Multiple bet types (spread + moneyline)
- [ ] Multiple bet types (spread + over/under)
- [ ] Multiple bet types (all three)

### Game Types
- [ ] NFL game
- [ ] CFB game

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Long editor notes (test text wrapping)
- [ ] Missing team logos (fallback behavior)
- [ ] Missing game date/time
- [ ] Negative spread values display correctly
- [ ] Positive moneyline values show "+" prefix

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] BuildShip endpoint unreachable (should log error, still publish)
- [ ] Discord API returns error (should log error, still publish)
- [ ] Network timeout (should fail gracefully)

## Code Changes Summary

### `src/components/EditorPickCard.tsx`
**Lines Modified**: 118-224 (handlePublish function)

**What Changed**:
- Added Discord posting logic after Supabase update succeeds
- Created `discordPayload` object with pick and game data
- Added `fetch` call to BuildShip endpoint
- Added error handling for Discord failures
- Added console logging for debugging

**Impact**:
- Zero impact on existing publish flow
- Discord posting is completely non-blocking
- Maintains all existing functionality
- No breaking changes

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Browser Console Logs
When publishing, you'll see:
```
üì§ Publishing with data: {...}
üîî Posting to Discord...
‚úÖ Posted to Discord successfully
```

Or if Discord fails:
```
üì§ Publishing with data: {...}
üîî Posting to Discord...
‚ùå Discord post failed: [error details]
```

### BuildShip Logs
Check BuildShip execution logs for:
- Received payload
- Formatted embed structure
- Discord API response
- Any errors or exceptions

### Discord Channel
Verify messages appear with:
- Correct team names and logos
- Proper odds formatting
- Complete editor notes
- Dynamic team colors

## Maintenance

### Updating Discord Channels
To post to a different channel, update line 185 in `EditorPickCard.tsx`:
```typescript
channelId: '1428843931889569893', // Change this ID
```

### Updating Message Format
Modify the BuildShip workflow's formatting code to change:
- Embed title/description
- Field names and layout
- Color schemes
- Footer text
- Emoji usage

### Adding Features
Potential future enhancements:
- Post to multiple channels (general + editors-picks)
- Add reaction buttons for Discord members
- Include betting trends or statistics
- Add links back to WagerProof app
- Include historical pick performance
- Tag specific Discord roles (@Subscribers)

## Troubleshooting

### "Discord post failed" in console
**Cause**: BuildShip endpoint returned error
**Solution**: 
1. Check BuildShip workflow is deployed
2. Verify endpoint URL is correct
3. Check BuildShip execution logs

### Message not appearing in Discord
**Cause**: Discord API rejected the request
**Solution**:
1. Verify bot token is valid
2. Check bot has channel permissions
3. Verify channel ID is correct
4. Check BuildShip logs for API response

### Incorrect formatting in Discord
**Cause**: Embed data malformed
**Solution**:
1. Check team color hex values are valid
2. Verify logo URLs are accessible
3. Check bet type formatting logic
4. Test with sample payload in BuildShip

### Pick publishes but no Discord attempt
**Cause**: Frontend code not executing
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify fetch call is being made
3. Check network tab for HTTP request
4. Review EditorPickCard.tsx changes
