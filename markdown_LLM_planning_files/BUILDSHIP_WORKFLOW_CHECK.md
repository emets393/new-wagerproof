# BuildShip Workflow Configuration Check

## Current Understanding

You have:
- ✅ Workflow ID: `wf_68ed847d7a44819095f0e8eca93bfd660fc4b093b131f0f0`
- ✅ Session creation working (returns `clientSecret`)
- ❌ No AI responses when sending messages

## The Core Issue

Your BuildShip workflow **successfully creates sessions** but **doesn't process chat messages**.

This means the workflow likely has ONLY the session generation part, not the message handling part.

## What BuildShip Workflow Needs

A complete ChatKit workflow needs **two capabilities**:

### 1. Session Generation ✅ (You have this)
```
Input: userId, userEmail, workflowId
  ↓
Create ChatKit session
  ↓
Output: clientSecret
```

### 2. Message Processing ❌ (You likely don't have this)
```
Input: user message, session info
  ↓
Process with OpenAI
  ↓
Output: AI response
```

## How to Check Your BuildShip Workflow

### Go to BuildShip Dashboard:
1. Open your workflow: `wf_68ed847d7a44819095f0e8eca93bfd660fc4b093b131f0f0`
2. Look at the nodes/blocks in the workflow

### What You Should See:

#### Minimal Workflow (Session Only):
```
[Trigger]
  ↓
[ChatKit Session Generator]
  ↓
[Return client_secret]
```

#### Complete Workflow (Session + Messages):
```
[Trigger]
  ↓
[ChatKit Session Generator]
  ↓
[Message Handler]
  ↓
[OpenAI Chat Completion]
  ↓
[Return AI Response]
```

## Questions to Answer

Looking at your BuildShip workflow:

1. **Does it have an OpenAI node?**
   - Yes → Good, check if it's connected
   - No → This is the problem

2. **Does it have a message handler?**
   - Yes → Check configuration
   - No → Need to add it

3. **Does it only return clientSecret?**
   - Yes → This is session-only workflow
   - Need to add message processing

4. **Is it a "ChatKit Session Generator" only?**
   - If so, you need a full "ChatKit Workflow" template

## How BuildShip ChatKit Should Work

### When User Opens Chat:
```
Frontend → BuildShip Workflow
Request: Create session
Response: { clientSecret: "ek_..." }
```

### When User Sends Message:
```
Frontend → ChatKit → OpenAI (via your workflow)
User: "Hello"
  ↓
ChatKit uses clientSecret
  ↓
Calls your workflow with message
  ↓
Workflow processes with OpenAI
  ↓
Returns: "Hi! How can I help you?"
  ↓
Appears in chat UI
```

## The Problem

If your workflow is ONLY for session generation:
- ✅ Sessions work
- ✅ UI loads
- ❌ Messages go nowhere
- ❌ No AI processing

## Solutions

### Solution A: Add Message Handling to Existing Workflow

In BuildShip:
1. Open your workflow
2. Add "Message Handler" node after session generator
3. Add "OpenAI Chat Completion" node
4. Configure OpenAI with:
   - API key
   - Model (gpt-4 or gpt-3.5-turbo)
   - System prompt for WagerBot
5. Connect to return node
6. Deploy

### Solution B: Use ChatKit Full Template

BuildShip likely has a full ChatKit template:
1. Create new workflow from template
2. Choose "ChatKit with OpenAI" or similar
3. Configure with your settings
4. Get new workflow ID
5. Update frontend code with new ID

### Solution C: Check ChatKit Configuration in BuildShip

Your workflow might need:
1. **ChatKit Domain** configured
2. **OpenAI API Key** set
3. **Agent/Assistant** configured
4. **Message routing** enabled

## What to Check in BuildShip Right Now

### 1. Workflow Nodes
Count the nodes - if it's just 2-3 nodes, it's probably session-only.

### 2. OpenAI Configuration
Look for OpenAI API key settings in the workflow or BuildShip project settings.

### 3. Workflow Type
Check if it's labeled as:
- "Session Generator" → Incomplete
- "ChatKit Full" → Should work
- "ChatKit + OpenAI" → Should work

### 4. Test Logs
In BuildShip:
- Go to Logs/History
- Send a message from your chat
- Check if BuildShip receives anything
- If no logs appear, messages aren't reaching BuildShip

## Quick Test

### In BuildShip Dashboard:
1. Find "Test" button on your workflow
2. Send this payload:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hello, this is a test"
    }
  ],
  "userId": "test-user"
}
```
3. Click Run/Test

**Expected Result:**
- Should process the message
- Should return an AI response

**If it fails:**
- Workflow doesn't have message processing
- Need to add OpenAI nodes

## Most Likely Scenario

Based on your symptoms, your BuildShip workflow is probably:
```
[HTTP Trigger]
  ↓
[ChatKit Session Generator Node]
  ↓
[Return { clientSecret }]
```

And it needs to be:
```
[HTTP Trigger]
  ↓
├─ [ChatKit Session Generator]
│  └─ [Return clientSecret]
│
└─ [Message Router]
   ↓
   [OpenAI Chat Completion]
   ↓
   [Return AI Response]
```

## Action Items

1. **Open BuildShip Dashboard Now**
2. **Find your workflow**
3. **Screenshot the workflow nodes**
4. **Check if there's an OpenAI node**
5. **If no OpenAI node → That's the problem!**

The frontend code is 100% correct. The issue is that BuildShip isn't processing messages because the workflow doesn't have that capability configured.

## Need Help?

Share:
1. Screenshot of your BuildShip workflow nodes
2. List of nodes in the workflow
3. Any error messages from BuildShip logs

Then we can identify exactly what's missing and how to add it!

## Remember

- Frontend ✅ Complete and working
- Session creation ✅ Working
- **Message processing ❌ Not configured in BuildShip**

This is a BuildShip configuration issue, not a frontend code issue!
