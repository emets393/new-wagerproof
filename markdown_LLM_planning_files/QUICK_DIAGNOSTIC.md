# Quick Diagnostic - No AI Responses

## What You're Seeing
✅ Message input box appears
✅ Can type and send messages
✅ Messages appear in the chat
❌ No AI responses coming back

## Most Likely Cause
**Your BuildShip workflow is only handling session creation, not message processing.**

## Immediate Things to Check

### 1. Browser Console (F12)
After sending a message, look for:

```
📨 ChatKit message received: { ... }
```
- **If you see this**: ChatKit is working, BuildShip issue
- **If you don't see this**: ChatKit isn't processing messages

```
❌ ChatKit error: { ... }
```
- **If you see this**: Read the error message carefully

### 2. Network Tab
After sending a message:
- Look for requests after you hit send
- Check if any requests go to BuildShip
- Look at request/response bodies
- Check for 4xx or 5xx errors

### 3. BuildShip Dashboard
Go to: https://buildship.app
- Find workflow: `wf_68ed847d7a44819095f0e8eca93bfd660fc4b093b131f0f0`
- Click "Logs" or "History"  
- Send a test message from your app
- See if logs show the message being received
- Check for any error messages

## What Your Workflow Needs

Your BuildShip workflow needs TWO capabilities:

### ✅ Session Creation (You have this)
Returns:
```json
{
  "sessionResponse": {
    "session": {
      "clientSecret": "ek_..."
    }
  }
}
```

### ❌ Message Handling (You likely don't have this)
Receives:
```json
{
  "messages": [...]
}
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "message": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "AI response here"
  }
}
```

## Quick Fix Options

### Option A: Check BuildShip Workflow Type
Your workflow might be set to "Session Generator Only"

**Fix**: Change to "Full ChatKit Workflow" or add message handling nodes

### Option B: Add OpenAI Node
If workflow doesn't have OpenAI chat completion:

1. Open workflow in BuildShip
2. Add "OpenAI Chat Completion" node
3. Connect it after message input
4. Configure with API key and model
5. Return response to ChatKit

### Option C: Use Different Workflow Template
BuildShip might have a "ChatKit Full" template:

1. Create new workflow from template
2. Choose "ChatKit with OpenAI"
3. Get new workflow ID
4. Update the code with new workflow ID

## Testing BuildShip Directly

### Test in BuildShip Dashboard:
1. Go to your workflow
2. Click "Test" or "Run"
3. Use this test input:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "test message"
    }
  ]
}
```
4. Click "Run"
5. Check if you get AI response back

**If no response**: Workflow needs message handling setup
**If error**: Check OpenAI API key and configuration
**If response works**: Issue might be in ChatKit configuration

## Updated Console Logging

I've added enhanced logging to ChatKitWrapper. You'll now see:

- 📨 When messages are received
- ❌ When errors occur  
- 🔄 When ChatKit state changes

Watch your browser console while sending messages!

## Common BuildShip Setups

### Setup 1: Session Only (What you probably have)
```
Trigger → ChatKit Session Generator → Return Secret
```
This only creates sessions, doesn't handle messages.

### Setup 2: Full Chat (What you need)
```
Trigger → ChatKit Session Generator → Return Secret
       → Message Handler
       → OpenAI Chat
       → Return Response
```

## Action Items

1. **Right Now**: 
   - Open browser console
   - Send a message
   - Look for 📨, ❌, or 🔄 logs
   - Screenshot any errors

2. **Check BuildShip**:
   - Open workflow in dashboard
   - Look at the nodes/steps
   - Find OpenAI chat completion node
   - If missing, that's your problem

3. **Verify OpenAI**:
   - Check API key is set
   - Verify key has credits
   - Test key at platform.openai.com

## Most Common Issue

**90% of the time**: BuildShip workflow only has session creation, missing the message processing logic.

**Solution**: Add OpenAI chat completion node to workflow or use a full ChatKit template from BuildShip.

## Need the Exact Fix?

Share:
1. Screenshot of BuildShip workflow nodes
2. BuildShip workflow logs after sending message
3. Browser console output with the 📨/❌/🔄 logs

Then I can tell you exactly what's missing!
