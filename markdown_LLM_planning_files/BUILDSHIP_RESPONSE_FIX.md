# BuildShip Response Format - Fixed

## Issue
The BuildShip workflow was returning the client secret in a nested structure that wasn't being properly extracted.

## Your BuildShip Response Format

```json
{
  "sessionResponse": {
    "metadata": {
      "timestamp": 1760404913815,
      "version": "1.0"
    },
    "session": {
      "status": "active",
      "id": "cksess_68eda5b1aee08190bf2de0eeaf270f3908285e528d963e04",
      "clientSecret": "ek_68eda5b1aeec81908f76aafafebbff7d08285e528d963e04_00eyJleHBpcmVzX2F0IjogMTc2MDQwNTUxM30=",
      "createdAt": "2025-10-14T01:21:53.815Z"
    }
  }
}
```

## Solution
Updated `chatSession.ts` to handle multiple response formats:

### Now Supports 3 Formats:

1. **Direct snake_case** (OpenAI standard):
   ```json
   { "client_secret": "ek_..." }
   ```

2. **Direct camelCase**:
   ```json
   { "clientSecret": "ek_..." }
   ```

3. **Nested structure** (your BuildShip format):
   ```json
   {
     "sessionResponse": {
       "session": {
         "clientSecret": "ek_..."
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Code Changes

The `getClientSecret` method now extracts the client secret from any of these formats:

```typescript
// Format 1: Direct client_secret (snake_case)
if (buildShipResult.client_secret) {
  clientSecret = buildShipResult.client_secret;
}
// Format 2: Direct clientSecret (camelCase)
else if (buildShipResult.clientSecret) {
  clientSecret = buildShipResult.clientSecret;
}
// Format 3: Nested in sessionResponse.session.clientSecret
else if (buildShipResult.sessionResponse?.session?.clientSecret) {
  clientSecret = buildShipResult.sessionResponse.session.clientSecret;
}
```

## What This Means

✅ Your current BuildShip workflow will work without any changes
✅ The client secret will be properly extracted from the nested response
✅ ChatKit will receive the correct secret format
✅ The message input UI should now appear

## Testing

1. Start the dev server (already running)
2. Navigate to WagerBot Chat page
3. Open browser console
4. You should see:
   ```
   BuildShip result received: { sessionResponse: { ... } }
   Client secret extracted successfully: { length: 87, prefix: "ek_68eda5b1aee..." }
   ```

## Console Logs to Watch For

**Success:**
```
Calling BuildShip workflow for client secret...
BuildShip response status: 200
BuildShip result received: [object Object]
Client secret extracted successfully: { length: 87, prefix: 'ek_68eda5b1aee...' }
```

**If it still fails:**
```
Error: No client secret found in BuildShip workflow response
```
This means the response format changed - check the full logged object.

## Your Client Secret Format

The client secret starts with `ek_` which indicates it's an **ephemeral key** from ChatKit:
```
ek_68eda5b1aeec81908f76aafafebbff7d08285e528d963e04_00eyJleHBpcmVzX2F0IjogMTc2MDQwNTUxM30=
```

This is correct and should work with ChatKit!

## Build Status
✅ Build successful - no errors
✅ Dev server running on port 8080

## Next Steps

1. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
2. Sign in to your account
3. Navigate to "WagerBot Chat" in the sidebar
4. The chat UI should now load with the message input box
5. Try sending a test message!

## If Message Input Still Missing

Check browser console for:
1. Any JavaScript errors
2. ChatKit initialization messages
3. The extracted client secret log

If the client secret is extracted successfully but UI still missing, the issue might be:
- ChatKit script not loading from CDN
- ChatKit control not initializing properly
- CSS/styling hiding the input box
- Browser compatibility issue

Try:
- Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Check Network tab for chatkit.js loading
